## Frequently Asked Questions

# Are the mods compatible with reshade?
    - Yes! Reshade is something completely separate, and you can have both in your game at the same time.

# Can I have multiple lighting mods in my game at once?
    - Yes and no. You can mix lighting mods (twinkle toes in rural windenburg and no blu in the bluffs) but you can't apply two lighting mods to the same world file since you can only have one of each file in your game at a time.

# Is { INSERT MOD HERE } compatible with the most recent patch?
    - Check the commit history, you'll see what version the mods are on and these versions correspond to the most recent compatible patch version!

# Will you update { OTHER PERSON'S MOD }?
     - No, the mods I've kept updated in this repo are the only ones I care to update.

# Do I need all the packs to use the mod?
    - Nope, just install the files for the worlds you have!

# Are the mods compatible with luumia's no blu and no glo mods?
    - Heck yeah! I <i>highly</i> recommend using them as well!

# Do the lighting mods affect indoor lighting as well?
    - Nope! It's for outdoor lighting only.
