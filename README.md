## Installation Guide

### BACK UP YOUR FILES FIRST

### How to Download the Files
In the upper right of this screen, there's a bright green button that says `clone or download`. Click that and select "Download as ZIP".

### Installing on Mac

1. Go to `Applications`, find The Sims 4, then left click and select "show  package contents". Follow the PC instructions below starting from step 2.

### Installing on PC

1. Navigate to wherever you’ve installed Sims 4 on your machine. For me, this is `C:\PROGRAM FILES (X86)\ORIGIN GAMES\THE SIMS 4`
    - Here, you’ll see some folders, but we only care about **DATA AND DELTA**. Data is where information for the base game is stored, and delta is for expansion/game/stuff packs. You’ll notice that these files correspond to the files in the lighting mod.
    - **IMPORTANT** Before moving on to the next step, I want to emphasize how important it is that you don't copy/paste full folders, only the `.world ` files you want to replace. These lighting mod downloads only contain the files needed for the worlds, but if you were to replace the `EP01` folder, you'd lose all of the build data for that expansion pack which - from what I know - will prevent your game from even opening. Just copy/paste the world files, okay? okay.
2. To install the base game files, **IN YOUR GAME FILES AND THE LIGHTING MOD FILES**, navigate to `data\shared\worlds\areas`, copy the files from the lighting mods folder, paste them into the game files folder, and replace the files when prompted.
3. To install the DLC files, go into DELTA folder, then the folder for the EP/GP you want, then `shared/worlds/areas`, then copy/paste like you did with the base game files. Here’s a list of each ep/gp and their worlds:
   - `EP01: Get to Work - police station, sixam, hospital, secret lab, magnolia promenade`
   - `EP02: Get Together -  windenburg`
   - `EP03: City Living - san myshuno`
   - `EP04: Cats & Dogs - brindleton bay`
   - `EP06: Get Famous - del sol valley`
   - `EP07: Island Living - sulani`
   - `GP01: Outdoor Retreat - granite falls`
   - `GP04: Vampires - forgotten hollow`
   - `GP06: Jungle Adventure - el selvadorada` 
 4. **To Uninstall** the lighting mods, just replace the lighting mod files with the ones you backed-up prior to installing (hope ya did that), or repair your game through origin. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm on a Mac and don't have TS4 in my Applications folder! What do I do?
Here are some helpful instructions from the delightful [goodsimaritan](https://goodsimaritan.tumblr.com/)!
First check if you have the sims 4 icon in your applications folder in finder. If you don’t, run the sims game and right click the icon in your dock and click show in finder. Now exit your game then move the sims 4 icon in finder to the applications folder. From there, right click on the sims 4 icon and click show package contents. Then just follow the instructions listed below.

### Are the mods compatible with reshade?
Yes! Reshade is something completely separate, and you can have both in your game at the same time.

### Is it possible to only download a single lighting mod?
Yes! go to [GitZip](http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/) and put the url of the directory containing the mod you want in the upper right corner, then click the `Download` button. Here are some example links that pull the most up-to-date version of each mod.
 - `astral lights: https://github.com/ts4cc/lighting-mods/tree/master/astral-lights`
 - `no blu: https://github.com/ts4cc/lighting-mods/tree/master/no-blu`
 - `no blu that's not orange: https://github.com/ts4cc/lighting-mods/tree/master/no-blu-not-orange`
 - `twinkle toes: https://github.com/ts4cc/lighting-mods/tree/master/twinkle-toes`

### Which version of the Astral Lights mod did you update?
I updated the aurora version only.

### Can I have multiple lighting mods in my game at once?
Yes and no. You can mix lighting mods (twinkle toes in rural windenburg and no blu in the bluffs) but you can't apply two lighting mods to the same world file since you can only have one of each file in your game at a time.

### Is { INSERT MOD HERE } compatible with the most recent patch?
Check the commit history, you'll see what version the mods are on and these versions correspond to the most recent compatible patch version!

### Will you update { OTHER PERSON'S MOD }?
No, the mods I've kept updated in this repo are the only ones I care to update.

### Do I need all the packs to use the mod?
Nope, just install the files for the worlds you have!

### Are the mods compatible with luumia's no blu and no glo mods?
Heck yeah! I <i>highly</i> recommend using them as well!

### Do the lighting mods affect indoor lighting as well?
Nope! It's for outdoor lighting only.
